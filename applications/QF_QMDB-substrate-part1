- **Level:** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

We are planning to integrate QMDB to Substrate for Parachains. The main goal is to increase the speed of transactions verification with QMDB. This is directly connected to the ecosystem since Polkadot has plans to integrate QMDB to Substrate.

### Project Details

Technology stack:
- RUST language for QMDB integration with Substrate
- DevOps tools for deployment and monitoring

Documentation:
- Core components and architecture documentation to be developed
- Integration specifications and API documentation
- Performance benchmarking methodology

Research and PoC:
- https://github.com/QuantumFusion-network/spec/issues/16
- https://qfnetwork.xyz/litepaper

What this project will not provide:
- Full prefix search functionality
- Production-ready indexing solution
- Advanced iterator implementation

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Target Audience:** All parachains for this iteration. We are avoiding the problem of migration as it won't be helpful for Polkadot L1 at this moment.
- **Project Fit:** The project directly integrates into Substrate's core infrastructure
- **Similar Projects:** Yes, Polkadot and QMDB team could do the same in the future
